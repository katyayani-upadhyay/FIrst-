# 📰 Fake News Detection using Machine Learning

This repository contains a machine learning-based solution for detecting fake news articles. The model analyzes the text content of news headlines or articles to classify whether the information is **real** or **fake**, helping combat the spread of misinformation across digital platforms.


## 🎯 Problem Statement

With the explosive growth of social media and online content, fake news has become a significant concern. Manual verification is time-consuming and infeasible at scale. This project automates fake news detection using **natural language processing (NLP)** and **supervised machine learning** techniques.


## 🔍 Features Used

* Text content (news articles or headlines)
* Token counts (word frequency)
* TF-IDF scores
* N-grams (bigrams/trigrams)
* Stopword removal, stemming/lemmatization


## 🛠️ Tech Stack

* **Language**: Python
* **Libraries**: Pandas, NumPy, NLTK, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib
* **Models**: Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes, Support Vector Machine (SVM), Random Forest
* **NLP Tools**: CountVectorizer, TfidfVectorizer, NLTK
* **Deployment (optional)**: Streamlit / Flask


## 📈 Model Workflow

1. **Data Collection**

   * Public datasets (e.g., Kaggle’s Fake News dataset)

2. **Text Preprocessing**

   * Lowercasing, punctuation removal
   * Stopword filtering
   * Tokenization and lemmatization

3. **Feature Extraction**

   * Bag-of-Words, TF-IDF, and N-gram modeling

4. **Model Training & Evaluation**

   * Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-Score
   * Confusion matrix visualization

5. **Deployment (Optional)**

   * Streamlit-based interactive fake news checker


## 🚀 Results

* Best model achieved **accuracy of 94.5%** on the test set
* **Precision** and **recall** values optimized to reduce false positives
* Real-time classification possible with minimal latency
